# RanchoStop: A virtual pet tarantula sim for the modern era

RanchoStop lets users adopt, care for, breed, and sell virtual tarantulas ("Ranchos"). Access to forums and profiles will help users connect with other like-minded individuals, all with an environment that divorces the word “Tarantula” from “creepy.”
